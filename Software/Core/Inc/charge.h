/** charge.h
 * Charge-enable state + array (MPPT boost) shutdown control.
 *
 * charge_enabled is the single "charging is allowed / boost on" flag. It is owned by
 * the precharge task (set true only once the array is precharged and cell voltage/temp
 * are within the charge limits with no active fault). Monitor tasks can force it off
 * immediately when a charge limit is crossed.
 *
 * When charge is disabled we soft-shut the array (boost disable -> delayed array open).
 * Re-enabling charge is rate-limited (charge_reenable_allowed) and gated by the monitor-task
 * voltage/temp hysteresis so charge enable cannot oscillate. The "still charging into an over-temp
 * pack" escalation lives in the temperature monitor task (temp-based, not charge-enable based).
